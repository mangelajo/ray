# Ray module

The ray module is a 3-channel LED controller, designed to be
small, and built on the OHAUT framework.

OHAUT framework provides the common web interface, WiFi management,
connectivity to other smart devices (like Alexa , homeassistant, etc..),
as well as an update system which allows firmware to be published on
this repository (see [the gh-pages branch](https://github.com/ohaut/ray/tree/gh-pages/firmware/master) ),
long term it probably makes more sense to release via github releases of binaries.

The firmware code for this device is available in the [firmware](./firmware) directory.

The hardware design for this devices is available in the [hardware](./hardware) directory.
